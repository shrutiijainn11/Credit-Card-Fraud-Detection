# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detection using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project involves building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The project uses Python and various machine learning libraries to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset for training.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement various algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.
